Metro-North Railroad Kawasaki M8 EMU V1.0 
(Consist 12.S2-1a; Triplet - Single - Pair - Pair - Pair - Pair)

This train is highly detailed and advanced. Keep reading for full details.

The M8 electric multiple unit was built in the between the 2000s and early 2010s for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. Seating layout is not 100% accurate as of this release.

In addition, hours of coding were put in to animating the 3D engineer's cab. Note that the cab's train status and diagnostic displays are semi-animated/semi-functional, as is the AC - DC mode selector switch.

Finally, note the placement of the cab doors throughout the consist; the end cars will have their cab doors closed, while the middle cars have them open.

The cab signalling on version 1.0 is not yet functional, but as soon as a route is coded that can make use of the cab signalling system, a plugin will be drafted and this pack will be updated to version 2.0.

Version 2.0 will also include animated destination signage, a detailed lavatory, and updated door sounds and seating layout.

Essential Operating Tips:
For openBVE purposes, this train has 6 power points, one for each major cab signal limit. Each point will increase acceleration proportionally.
P1 - 15 mph (24 km/h); 0.5 mph/s
P2 - 30 mph (32 km/h) 
P3 - 45 mph (72 km/h)
P4 - 60 mph (96 km/h)
P5 - 80 mph (128 km/h); 2.0 mph/s
P6 - 100 mph (160 km/h); 2.0 mph/s

For openBVE purposes, this train has 4 service brake points, each increasing the brake rate by increments of 0.75 mph/s.
B1 - B3 are dynamic/regenerative brake only.
B4 blends in friction brakes to achieve full service brake rate of 3.0 mph/s.

IMPORTANT; How to operate the pantograph (switch between AC-DC and vice versa):
Hit "3" to turn ATS off and lower pantograph (AC-DC), hit "2" to turn ATS on and raise pantograph (DC-AC). It is recommended that you only make the AC-DC switch while moving. Do not make the DC-AC switch while moving, as activating the ATS from "off state" will immediately apply emergency brakes; thus, only raise the pantograph when the train is stopped. Hopefully, a plugin for V2.0 will remove this requirement.
